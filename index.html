		<div class="graybar">Objective</div>
			<div class="graybox">Become best front-end developer ever!</div>
		<div class="graybar">Education</div>
			<div class="graybox">Mym mum said I attended a really good kindergarden and she has even some photos to prove that. There is where I got statred with english. Next was of course primary school with special enlglish course, than junior high school and guess what! Yup, english again. And some really good computer science. Now I'm in french class in Second High School in Bydgoszcz. And I have no idea what I'm doing there since I'd like to study computer science.</div>
		<div class="graybar">Skills</div>
			<div class="graybox">I have georgeous smile but I don't use it unless it's some special occasion. And now seriously. I learn really quickly if want to, I don't have problems with english unless it's not techical IT language, I started HTML and CSS course at codecademy.com, and I really like carrots (So does my rat Jupiter).</div>
		<div class="graybar">What do you expect about this training</div>
			<div class="graybox">Learn some javascript, meet new people, have fun, get angry with my computer at most three times.</div>
		<div class="graybar">Hobbies</div>
			<div class="graybox">Other than programming? Some standard these days: reading fantasy as well as writing it, watching Disney movies, singing Disney songs. And less standard: making cheese, growing plants and training my rat Jupiter. Oh, and scouting!</div>
		<div class="graybar">Personality</div>
			<div class="graybox"><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Funny but not funny<br/><br/>
			<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Inteligent and crative<br/><br/>
			<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-ok"></span> Really shy, that's why I like computers - they don't ask<br/><br/></div>

	<div class="footer"> Letter of motivation<br/>
		<p3>If you still need additional motivation after I presented myself so creatively and precisely there can be just one more thing to promise: I won't bring my rat on this course. Anyway, I hope you can't wait to meet me as much as I can wait to meet you and work together on a project. See you soon!</p3>
